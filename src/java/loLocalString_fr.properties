ta.desc=<b>AMRP Spend</b><br>\
This boundary represents a specified percentage of AIR MILES Collector spend at a location. Based on actual Collector behavior, it can be used for more refined targeted marketing, or to help identify differences between locations, when comparing trade area size. The pull down menu allows for a user defined trade area value.<br>\
<br>\
Trade Areas are drawn by starting with the AIR MILES Collectors active at each location, based on a user defined timeframe. The distance from the Collector address to the location address is calculated. Collectors are then sorted by distance (closest to furthest from the location), and are then selected, in that order, until the user specified percentage of total sales (i.e. 60%) for that location is reached. These Collectors are then mapped and a boundary is drawn around their outer limits.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Drive Distance</b><br>\
A boundary will be drawn around each selected location representing the distance entered.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Projected Location</b><br>\
Once a location has been placed on the map using the flag button, a boundary is drawn around that point, representing the distance entered.<br>\
<br>\
<br>\
<u>Interpreting a trade area</u><br>\
The size of a location\u2019s AIR MILES trade area will indicate the spatial behavior of Collectors shopping at the location. A small trade area suggests that Collectors who shop at that location tend to live within relatively close proximity. This is typical for retailers that cater to a local population, (i.e. strip malls).  Large Trade Areas represent the opposite, indicating that Collectors are traveling from greater distances. The reason for this larger representation could be due to factors not specifically related to the location in question, (i.e. it is close to a workplace, near a theatre, within a regional mall, etc).<br>\
Also, trades areas for locations situated in rural areas are often larger, as people residing in these regions are accustomed to driving further for goods and services<br>\
<br>\
<u>Caveats</u><br>\
<i>Locations must have a minimum number of Collector points to create an insightful trade area<br>\
Rural locations may output trade areas that are oddly shaped due to the nature of data in these areas.</i>

<b>Address</b><br>\
Any part of an address can be searched, such as FSA, postal code, or city name, however, a complete address will return the most accurate result. As an address is being entered, suggested addresses may be displayed, and can be selected at anytime. Points of interest can also be searched, (i.e. Eaton\u2019s Centre, Toronto).<br>\
<br>\
<b>Location Code</b><br>\
This is the 4 character location code that is specific to the AIR MILES program. In many cases this may be the same value as the corporate store identifier.

This allows for a more fiscal approach to defining store territories, or when comparing different timeframes, will illustrate the impact of changes in the marketplace, such as new location openings on existing locations.<br><br>Neighbourhoods in this case are defined using Statistics Canada Dissemination Area (DA) boundaries. These boundaries represent between 400 and 700 persons, and are a fairly stable geographic area. For more information on this geography please refer to the following link\: <a href\="http\://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/geo021.htm" target\="_blank">Dissemination Area (DA)</a><br><br>Using the AIR MILES data for the selected timeframe each Collector has their DA assigned to them using their address. All AIR MILES spend in each DA is aggregated to the location level\u2026<br><br><b>Primary Location</b><br>Neighbourhoods are coloured for the location that has the greatest amount of AIR MILES sales allocated.<br><br><b>Majority Location</b><br>Neighbourhoods are coloured for the location that has more than 50% of total AIR MILES sales allocated.<br><br><b>Interpreting the Maps</b><br>Typical patterns show clusters of neighbourhoods of one colour and the location they represent inside the cluster. This indicates that the neighbourhoods surrounding the location, for the most part, tend to shop at their closest location, a commonly seen pattern. When there are multiple coloured DA\u2019s clustered together, with no location near it, the sales activity reveals that there is no specific location allocated in this area, and Collectors living in these neighbourhoods travel to a variety of locations.

<b>Distance Decay</b><br>\
Collector activity is summarized by distance band, (i.e. 0-2km , 2-5km, ...). Collector volumes and AIR MILES spend Activity at the AIR MILES program level, Sponsor level, and Sponsor location level are represented. <br>\
<br>\
<b>Location Summary</b><br>\
Within the boundary of a trade area, the distance boundary of an existing location, or the distance boundary of a projected location, the AIR MILES spend and Collector activity is summarized, showing the top 10 locations represented.  <br>\
<br>\
<b>Screen Report</b><br>\
The map in screen view will be captured in the report, along with the selected summaries.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Batch</b><br>\
A report, along with a map and selected summaries, will be created for each selected location. The same information will be shown for each location based on the layers currently active in map view.<br>\
<br>\
When reports are ready a download button will appear. The report will be available in PDF format and will require Adobe Reader to open. Depending on the number of locations selected, batch reporting can take some time to process.
