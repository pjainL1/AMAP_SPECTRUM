ta.desc=Spend and Unit Trade Areas are drawn by starting with the AIR MILES Collectors active at each location, based on the user defined timeframe. The distance from the Collector address to the location address is calculated. Collectors are then sorted by distance (closest to furthest from the location), and are then selected, in that order, until the user specified percentage of total sales/units (i.e. 60%) for that location is reached. These Collectors are then mapped and a boundary is drawn around their outer limits.<br><br>\
<b>AMRP Spend Trade Area</b><br>\
This boundary represents the closest specified percentage of AIR MILES Collector spend at a location. The pull down menu allows for a user defined trade area percentage value. <br>\
<br>\
<b>AMRP Units Trade Area</b><br>\
This boundary represents the closest specified percentage of AIR MILES Collector units at a location. An example of a unit can be fuel volume, liquor volume, or transaction counts. Consult with LoyaltyOne support to understand what unit represents. (<a href="mailto:gis_analytics@loyalty.com">gis_analytics@loyalty.com</a>)<br>\
<br>\
<b>Drive Distance Trade Area</b><br>\
A boundary will be drawn around each selected location representing the distance entered.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Projected Location Trade Area</b><br>\
Once a location has been placed on the map using the flag button, a drive distance boundary is drawn around that point, representing the distance entered.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Custom Trade Area</b><br>\
A user defined trade area can be drawn on the map. Any location(s) selected will be associated to the trade area and summarized in the info window.\u00a0<br>\
<br>\
<b>Download Postal Code Info</b><br>\
Postal codes that fall within the trade area(s) can be extracted for AIR MILES marketing purposes. If a location(s) is selected, a straight line distance (km) is calculated from each postal code to the location and included in the output file.<br>\
<br>\
<u>Interpreting an AMRP Spend / Unit Trade Area</u><br>\
The size of a location\u2019s AIR MILES trade area will indicate the spatial behavior of Collectors shopping at the location. A small trade area suggests that Collectors who shop at that location tend to live within relatively close proximity. This is typical for retailers that cater to a local population, (i.e. strip malls). Large Trade Areas represent the opposite, indicating that Collectors are traveling from greater distances. The reason for this larger representation could be due to factors not specifically related to the location in question, (i.e. it is close to a workplace, near a theatre, within a regional mall, etc).<br>\
Also, trades areas for locations situated in rural areas are often larger, as people residing in these regions are accustomed to driving further for goods and services<br>\
<br>\
<u>Caveats</u><br>\
<i>Locations must have a minimum number of Collector points to create an insightful trade area<br>\
Rural locations may output trade areas that are oddly shaped due to the nature of data in these areas.</i>

For a single date range HotSpot maps are created by using point level data (i.e. Collector addresses), and displaying the varying levels of densities with 5 graduated colours. The purple areas represent the areas with the highest density, while the green areas the lowest. There are three options for HotSpot mapping for a single date range.<br>\
<br>\
<b>AIR MILES Program Active</b><br>\
This displays density of AIR MILES Collectors who have been active in the program within the past 12 months at any Sponsor.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Sponsor Active</b><br>\
This displays density of activity for all Collectors active at any of your locations within the selected timeframe.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Selected Locations</b><br>\
This displays density of activity for Collectors active at the selected location(s) within the selected timeframe.<br>\
<br>\
The following three options are available for Sponsor active and Selected Locations only.<br>\
<br>\
<li>AIR MILES Spend Density: HotSpot is created using the total AIR MILES spend</li>\
<li>AIR MILES Unit Density: HotSpot is created using the volume of AIR MILES units. An  example of a unit can be fuel volume, liquor volume, or transaction counts. Consult with LoyaltyOne support to understand what unit represents. (<a href="mailto:gis_analytics@loyalty.com">gis_analytics@loyalty.com</a>)</li>\
<li>Collector Density: HotSpot is created using the volume of Collectors</li>\
<br>\
Using the slider, opacity of the HotSpot layer can be adjusted in order to view the layers underneath the HotSpot.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Comparison Analysis</b><br>\
The comparison of activity can be mapped for Collectors, Transactions, Spend, or Units. When selecting a comparison date range in Data Filtering the output changes to a grid format and compares the activity in each grid between the two selected date ranges at the Sponsor or Location level. If the minimum amounts are set in data filtering section the filter will be applied on both periods however the data filtering will not apply for Collector level comparison.<br>\
<br>\
The pull down allows for a specific type of Collector activity to be summarized<br>\
<li>Blended \u2013 Maps all Collectors and summarizes the level of change in activity at the grid level between the two time ranges.</li>\
<li>Growth - Maps Collectors who have grown their activity between the two time ranges and summarizes the level of change in activity at the grid level.</li>\
<li>Decline - Maps Collectors who have decreased their activity between the two time ranges and summarizes the level of change in activity at the grid level.</li>

<br>\
Neighbourhoods in this case are defined using Statistics Canada Dissemination Area (DA) boundaries. These boundaries represent between 400 and 700 persons, and are a fairly stable geographic area. For more information on this geography please refer to the following link: <a href\="http\://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/geo021.htm" target\="_blank">Dissemination Area (DA)</a><br>\
<br>\
Using the AIR MILES data for the selected timeframe each Collector has their DA assigned to them using their address, and the activity is aggregated for each location in each DA.<br>\
<li>Total Spend</li>\
<li>Total Units</li><br>\
<b>Primary Location</b><br>\
Neighbourhoods are coloured for the location that has the greatest amount of AIR MILES sales or units allocated.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Majority Location</b><br>\
Neighbourhoods are coloured for the location that has more than 50% of total AIR MILES sales or units allocated.<br>\
<br>\
When data filtering minimum values are entered the neighbourhood watch analysis excludes those Collectors. Neighbourhood watch does not however use the comparison period option.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Interpreting the Maps</b><br>\
Typical patterns show clusters of neighbourhoods of one colour and the location they represent inside the cluster. This indicates that the neighbourhoods surrounding the location, for the most part, tend to shop at their closest location, a commonly seen pattern. When there are multiple coloured DA\u2019s clustered together, with no location near it, the sales/unit activity reveals that there is no specific location allocated in this area, and Collectors living in these neighbourhoods travel to a variety of locations.

filter.menu.title=Data Filtering
filter.desc=\
Data Filtering enables the user to select a timeframe for analysis, a second timeframe for comparison analysis, and set minimum activity levels for each Collector prior to performing analysis in a-map.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Date Range</b><br>\
<li>Single \u2013 One date range is used for analysis</li> \
<li>Comparison \u2013 A second date range can be selected for comparison analysis. Period 2 would typically be an earlier timeframe to compare to period 1 i.e. Year over year.</li> \
<br>\
The default button will change Period 1 to the default 12 month period and If comparison analysis is selected period 2 will be the same 12 month period in the previous year (YOY).<br>\
<br>\
A minimum value can be set for each Collector for the selected timeframe and only those Collectors that meet the criteria in the single timeframe are mapped. In comparison mode the minimum must be met for in both timeframes. Leaving the minimum blank will set no limits.<br>\
<br>\
<li>Min Transactions Per Collector</li> \
<li>Min AMRP Spend Per Collector</li> \
<li>Min AMRP Units Per Collector</li>

<b>Distance Decay</b><br>\
Collector activity is summarized by distance band, (i.e. 0-2km , 2-5km, ...). Collector volumes and AIR MILES spend Activity at the AIR MILES program level, Sponsor level, and Sponsor location level are represented. <br>\
<br>\
<b>Location Summary</b><br>\
Within the boundary of a trade area, the distance boundary of an existing location, or the distance boundary of a projected location, the AIR MILES spend and Collector activity is summarized, showing the top 10 locations represented.  <br>\
<br>\
<b>Screen Report</b><br>\
The map in screen view will be captured in the report, along with the selected summaries.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Batch</b><br>\
A report, along with a map and selected summaries, will be created for each selected location. The same information will be shown for each location based on the layers currently active in map view.<br>\
<br>\
When reports are ready a download button will appear. The report will be available in PDF format and will require Adobe Reader to open. Depending on the number of locations selected, batch reporting can take some time to process.

Total store activity can be compared among all stores by representing stores as different coloured symbols on a map. This allows for a quick visual representation and a better understanding of any spatial patterns.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Single Date Range</b><br>\
For a single date range 5 different coloured symbols represent the different levels of store activity during the timeframe. For each store total Collectors, Spend, Transactions and Units can be compared. By default the ranges are system generated however users can modify the ranges and those ranges are saved for the next time the module is used.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Comparison Date Range</b><br>\
If a second timeframe is being used for comparison the change in total store activity from period 2 to period 1 is measured and 5 different coloured symbols will represent the different levels of change. <br>\
<br>\
When data filtering minimum values are entered the store level analysis excludes those Collectors in its store level summary however the data filtering will not apply for Collector level comparison.
